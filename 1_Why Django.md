 * Pagination
 * Category
 * Search
* User login/logout system

I highly recommend the Djngo framework as a starting place for new Python web developers.
Django is a high-level web framework, written in Python, which was created for quick web project development.

### Ridiculously fast
Django was designed to help developers take applications from concept to completion as quickly as possible.
### Reassuringly secure
Django takes security seriously and helps developers avoid many common security mistakes.
### Exceedingly scalable
Some of the busiest sites on the Web leverage Djangoâ€™s ability to quickly and flexibly scale.
The Official tutorial "Getting started with Django" and "Django documentation" is really good to start making web site.
